# loveLetter
An (incomplete) pygame recreation of the card game "Love Letter".
The end goal was something that worked online. I had previously experimented with socket and pickle to make an online rock paper scissors game.

I ultimately forgot about this project and left it incomplete, but I may pick up where I left off soon.
